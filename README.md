The code base contain 6 classes each correspond to one of the systems:
1. ANTs: Penalized_search.py
2. GMC: GMC_search.py
3. Stamire: test_naive_search_export.py
4. SemNov: Semantic_Novelty_search.py
5. StarmieGold: StarmieO_search.py
6. StarmieOne: Starmie1_search.py



## Datasets
The repository also includes the code developed for constructing the customized benchmark datasets and performing data dilution.
